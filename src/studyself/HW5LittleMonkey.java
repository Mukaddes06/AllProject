                Lyrics
        5 little monkeys jumping on the bed
        One fell off and bumped his head
        Mama called the doctor
        And the doctor said
        No more monkeys jumping on the bed
​
        4 little monkeys jumping on the bed
        One fell off and bumped her head
        Mama called the doctor
        And the doctor said,
        No more monkeys jumping on the bed
​
        3 little monkeys jumping on the bed
        One fell off and bumped his head
        Mama called the doctor
        And the doctor said,
        No more monkeys jumping on the bed
​
        2 little monkeys jumping on the bed
        One fell off and bumped her head
        Mama called the doctor
        And the doctor said,
        No more monkeys jumping on the bed
​
        1 little monkey jumping on the bed
        One fell off and bumped his head
        Mama called the doctor
        And the doctor said,
        Put those monkeys right to bed
​
        ---- Consider this ----
        Legend of 5 little monkeys:
​
        Pay closer attention to the actual Lyrics
        There are 3 boy monkeys and 2 girl monkeys
        the order monkeys fall down is
        5 - boy - bumped *his* head
                - No more monkeys jumping on the bed
​
        4 - girl - bumped *her* head
                - No more monkeys jumping on the bed
​
        3 - boy - bumped *his* head
                - No more monkeys jumping on the bed
​
        2 - girl - bumped *her* head
                - No more monkeys jumping on the bed
​
        When there is only one monkey the Lyrics change
        1 little monkey(not monkeys)
        1 - boy - bumped *his* head
                - Put those monkeys right to bed  */
